# Task

Based on the included mockup, create a single page application which will display a list of au pairs and their personal details.The user will be able to filter the list of au pairs based on criteria (left sidebar) as well as search.

*This project was generated with the help of [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.11-webpack.2.*


### Notes:

* It should be developed using Angular 2. `angular-cli` has been included to help get started, but the choice is up to you on how you prefer to scaffold the application
* The filters are only accepting single values - they are not multiselect *(extra points if you make them multiselect)*
* The search functionality searches in the name and "about" text (the *lorem ipsum* one)
* Search input and filters are working together in an **AND** relationship, meaning that if a filter is selected, the search will take that into account, and vice-versa
* Extra points if it is responsive
* No need to worry about cross-browser issues - will be viewed in Chrome


### Included files:

* The mockup in [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/) (for MacOS users) or PDF format
* In the `/src` directory are included the bootstrap file, the main `index.html` file, and files needed for angular & angular-cli such as polyfills, tsconfig and typings
* In the `/src/app` directory are included the component's files, as well as the data.json file with mock data of users and their personal details
* In the `/src/assets` directory are included:
	* An `/icons` directory with SVG symbols definition and a folder with all individual SVGs, so that you can choose which one you prefer to use
	* A `/css` directory with an .scss file with some basic variables to help you get started


### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


### Expected deliverable:

* A complete and fully functioning application, as a zip file, 
that I can install and run on any computer
